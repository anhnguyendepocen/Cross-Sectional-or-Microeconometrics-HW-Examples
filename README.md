Cross-Sectional-or-Micro-Econometrics-HW-Examples
=================================================

This repository contains the supporting files for some HW assignments completed for a graduate course in Cross Sectional or Microeconometrics.  The course followed Cameron &amp; Trivedi's Microeconometrics: Methods and Applications textbook.  All assignments are from taken from that text.  Many of the STATA files used were partially based on the supplemental materials provided by the authors on the text's companion website.  When this is the case, the STATA files not this in the initial comments.  The site also provides easy access to all data sets used in these files, so they are not included here.  The following files are included:

1. Microeconometrics-HW-1.pdf is the main written HW1 submission.
2. Microeconometrics-HW-1.tex is the LaTex file that generates 1.
3. Microeconometrics-HW1.do is the STATA .do file that generates the analysis.
4. HW1_Ackerman.log is a STATA .log file that details the successful excecution of 3.
5. Microeconometrics-HW-2.pdf is the main written HW2 submission.
6. Microeconometrics-HW-2.tex is the LaTex file that generates 5.
7. Microeconometrics-HW2.do is the STATA .do file that generates the analysis.
8. HW2_Ackerman.log is a STATA .log file that details the successful excecution of 7.
9. Microeconometrics-HW-6.pdf is the main written HW6 submission.
10. Microeconometrics-HW-6.tex is the LaTex file that generates 9.
11. Microeconometrics-HW6.do is the STATA .do file that generates the analysis.
12. HW6_Ackerman.log is a STATA .log file that details the successful excecution of 11.
